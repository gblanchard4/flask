Having some fun with python, raspberry pi, and flask

# What are we doing here?  
This was a fun little weekend project for me to learn a bit about flask and javascript  
  
##I built a flask app, but what does it do?
The app uses AJAX to update the temperature on the webpage every .5 seconds. It gets the temperature from a DS18B20 temperature sensor hooked up to my raspberry pi.
